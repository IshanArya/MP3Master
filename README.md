# MP3Master
Simple program that parses mp3skull website and downloads songs to computer. Also works to fix id3 info on downloaded songs

## How to Operate
Just run jar file, put in some search you want to do, click "enter" or the button.
**NOTE: Don't add any punctuation in your search. I haven't factored that in, yet, so it messes up the search. Also put in artist name for better results (e.g. "she will be loved maroon 5").**

## Stuff to Add
* Spotify support for more accurate results and easier music retrieval

## Disclaimers
* I do not host any of the files that you may download. All my program does is access mp3skull's website and retrieve the download links. Imagine this as a browser just for mp3skull
* Don't use this ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
